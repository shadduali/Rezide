Any application/system initiating the request pertinent to subscriptions will call the standard HTTP/s or APIs exposed by the subscription engine. 2. SE will only support VAS services subscription life cycle management. 3. SE will not store any application/content specific information in its database. 4. UCS will provide the Fetch balance API. 5. UCS must support the volume required for subscriptions request with low latency and high throughput. 6. UCS will do the load balancing of the request landing on its system. 7. UCS denies the charging request if the subscriber is in grace on IN 8. SE will provide the start and stop notification to respective applications for content delivery except for scenario wherein SE will fetch and deliver the content 9. SE will maintain the usage counters for the scenarios wherein SE will fetch and deliver the content else it will be maintained by respective applications responsible for delivering the content/service. 10. Applications responsible for delivering the content/service will send the usage exhaust notification to SE. 11. For daily subscription packs, pre-renewal notification message will not be sent by SE. 12. For daily subscription packs, if charging fails than SE will retry charging only once. 13. For trigger charging, e.g. charging on match day, if charging fails than SE will retry charging only once. 14. For blackberry, modify service request scenario, existing blackberry service will be replaced by new requested blackberry service, hence requested black berry service will be provisioned only on RIM server and not on HLR. 15. For blackberry, modify plan request scenario, existing blackberry service plan will be replaced by new requested blackberry service plan, hence requested black berry service plan will neither be provisioned on RIM server nor on HLR. 16. Mediation will be responsible for maintaining the consistent provisioning across HLR and RIM server. 17. Any application/system initiating pre charged subscription request will invoke the SE API by providing pre charged flag as one of the parameter else SE will charge for that subscription again 18. For successful charging in suspended period, next renewal date will be calculated starting from the same day. 19. GPRS service will be provisioned in HLR by default for prepaid and postpaid subscribers. 20. GPRS pre charged subscription initiation based on IN recharge scenario, if the subscriber's GPRS plan is already changed on same day than SE will reject the subscription request. 21. Subscription engine will not apply any business rules pertinent to any subscription orders for postpaid. 22. For all the Combo packs will apply only step charging as the business model 23. In combo 1 scenario, renewal charging would be based on priority defined by the product manager in low balance scenario 24. In combo 3 and combo 4 scenario, renewal will be based on the longest running service of the combo pack 25. In the scenarios where pin validation is required, respective systems will be responsible to do the pin validations before handing over the request to subscription engine, i.e. subscription engine will not perform any pin validations nor will it maintain the pin in its system. 26. During the pre to post and post to pre migration, MSISDN will remain same. 27. In pre to post and post to pre migration, services deprovisioning of subscriber on HLR will be done through order management. 28. In post to pre migration, blackberry deprovisioning on RIM will be done through order management. The following are the dependencies for successful execution of subscription engine solution 1) ICL will provide the combo pack business logic well in advance. 2) ICL will provide the exact definitions of existing subscription services well in advance. 3) ICL will provide the format for adjustment code pertinent to subscription 4) Provide the discovery channels integration details with subscription engine System Context The figure 2-1 below depicts centralized subscription engine in the context of all other interacting SDP components in ICL's ecosystem.

RIM Server Solution Overview This section will outline the solution architecture of subscription manager in Idea SDP ecosystem. 1 Logical Architecture Diagram The below figure depicts the logical architecture of the subscription engine solution as a fraction of ICL's SDP ecosystem. This figure shows the major high level modules which are involved in subscription engine solution. [pic] Figure 3-2: Subscription Manager Logical Architecture Diagram 2 Solution Architecture Overview Diagram The figure 3-1 provides the system level overview of subscription manager positioning in IDEA SDP environment. This figure depicts the interactions of subscription engine with the various systems or components not only in the ICL's eco system but also with the applications hosted by various VAS vendors outside IDEA environment. [pic] Figure 3-2: Subscription Manager Architecture Overview Diagram 3 Solution Description As depicted above, in the overall IDEA SDP solution, Boun Giorno's subscription engine is positioned as a centralized subscription engine to facilitate the centralized management of VAS subscription activations, renewals and upgrades so that ICL's core infrastructure and applications can focus on efficient service delivery. Centralized subscription engine will collapse the multiple subscription engines viz. Cellebrum, One97, Phoneytunes and OnMobile, in current ICL's eco system to provide the single subscription engine which will lay the foundation for different subscription models across ICL VAS subscription offerings. The detailed solution of centralized subscription engine in ICL's environment is depicted in above two figures viz. logical and technical architecture diagram. The description of the solution will be based on the mapping of logical architecture with the individual systems/components involved in the overall subscription engine solution. 1 Discovery Channel Layer This layer shows the various channels viz. SMS, USSD, STK, WAP, WEB, IVR, OBD, CRM, Vtopups and Sanchaya, through which subscribers can place the orders pertinent to VAS subscriptions which in turn constitutes of various discovery network and software based components viz. SMSC, messaging gateway, SGSN, WAP gateway, USSD gateway, etc. The request can be initiated through any of the channels but will be landed on subscription engine in the unified format. 1 Subscription Engine - Messaging Gateway 1 SMS and STK Channel The subscription request discovered by the subscriber through SMS and STK channel will be sent to the messaging gateway via SMSC using CIMD protocol. The messaging gateway in turn will forward the request to the subscription engine on the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 2 USSD The subscription request discovered by the subscriber through USSD channel will be sent to the messaging gateway via USSD gateway using SMPP protocol. The messaging gateway in turn will forward the request to the subscription engine on the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 2 Subscription Engine - WAP gateway The subscription request discovered by the subscriber through WAP portal will be sent to the subscription engine on the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 3 Subscription Engine - IVR/OBD Portal The subscription request discovered by the subscriber through IVR/OBD will forward the request to the subscription engine on the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 4 Subscription Engine - Web Portal The subscription request discovered by the subscriber through Web portal will be sent to the web proxy using HTTPS protocol. The web proxy in turn will forward the request to the subscription engine on the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 5 Subscription Engine - CRM The subscriber places the orders pertinent to subscription by giving the call to the call centre agents which in turn can place the orders through the customer care module of subscription engine integrated with IDEA CRM systems using silent login feature. The customer care module of subscription engine will internally invoke the HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 6 Subscription Engine - Other Channels The subscription can also be discovered through other channels wherein the respective channel applications need to integrate with the standard HTTPS interface exposed by the subscription engine. 2 Charging Layer Subscription engine after applying the rating for the requested subscription service will initiate the charging request to the charging layer for the fulfillment of following type of request > Fetch balance > Debit request > Credit request 1 UCS The charging layer is realized via UCS component which acts as an abstraction layer/charging gateway on top of multiple INs to hide the integration complexities of subscription engine directly interacting with multiple INs. The subscription engine will interact with IN via UCS to fulfill the above mentioned functionalities. The UCS will expose the standard HTTPS interface to the subscription engine which will be invoked for real time charging of the subscriber pertinent to subscription services. The subscription engine will provide the adjustment code during the credit/debit request to UCS which in turn will provide it to IN. IN will inject the adjustment code in to its DRs which will be later used by BSS downstream systems like RA, RSS, etc. for accounting, settlement and reconciliation purpose 3 Subscriber Profile Repository Subscription engine will fetch the subscriber profile from the subscriber profile repository which is relevant for performing the following task > Validations based on subscriber profile pertinent to requested subscriptions > Update the subscriber's subscription profile 1 Unified User Profile The subscriber profile repository is realized via UUP component that act as a centralized subscriber profile repository with in IDEA SDP ecosystem. The following task will be performed by subscription engine on UUP. 1 Fetch Subscriber Profile Subscription engine will be fetching the following subscriber details from the UUP for the request pertinent to subscriptions. > Basic Profile V Prepaid Flag V Circle ID V Status V Category V LoB > Port in/port out The SE will perform the following validations for the subscription request of subscriber against the subscriber profile. o Whether the subscriber is ported out subscriber. o Whether the subscriber belongs to prepaid or post paid. o Whether the subscriber is eligible or belongs to the category (viz. Gold, silver, youth, etc) for which this subscription service has been offered. o Whether the subscriber is black listed. o Check the status of subscriber. o Whether the requested subscription service exist for that subscriber's circle or not. o Whether the requested subscription services need to be offered to the particular LOB (viz. Mobility, data card, PCO, etc) of the subscriber's or not. o Whether the requested subscription service have been discovered via valid channel or not. 2 Update Subscription Profile Also, SE will update the subscriber profile after the fulfillment of subscription request by subscription engine. The following are the scenarios in which subscription profile will be updated by subscription engine in UUP. > Activation of subscription > Renewal of subscription > Deactivation > Active to grace > Grace to Suspension > Suspension to Active > Grace to Active Note: When the subscription service for the subscriber is deactivated, the subscription service which needs to be deactivated for a subscriber will be deleted from UUP. 4 Integration Layer Subscription engine on successful charging will push the request to integration layer in async mechanism for provisioning the subscription of subscriber in network elements like HLR, RIM server and postpaid billing system viz. BSCS iX. Also, subscription engine will fetch the provisioning related information from NSMS if the provisioning related information is not found in UUP. 1 EAI The integration layer is realized via EAI system which already exists in IDEA IT eco system and the same is being leveraged for the subscription engine solution for the provisioning in HLR, RIM server and postpaid billing system BSCS iX. 1 HLR Provisioning There are specific set of services as mentioned below which requires the HLR provisioning during the life cycle management of the subscription for subscriber. > GPRS > Blackberry > Ring back tone > Miss Call Alert > Select Call > Pre tone AS- IS HLR provisioning Approach The existing HLR provisioning approach for prepaid and postpaid has been described below. For postpaid, all circles and For Prepaid Ericsson circles only 1) Subscription Engine currently uses the IVSM component as a channel for provisioning the subscription service in to BSCS 6 (for postpaid subscribers) and HLR. 2) IVSM component accepts 3 parameters viz. Appsource, Requestcode and circle id, for fulfilling provisioning request. NOTE: App source and request code is provided by IDEA to the vendors. 3) IVSM fetch the details pertinent to BSCS 6 viz. SN code, network type flag, history table name, etc. based on Appsource, Requestcode and circle id. 4) Based on the activation or deactivation request following validations are done by IVSM a. Whether the subscriber is active in BSCS or not b. Requested service is currently inactive for activation request and active for deactivation request c. Whether the service can be assigned under the current rate plan or not 5) For network related services where HLR provisioning is required, BSCS 6 will forward the provisioning request to mediation which in turn will activate the service for subscriber in HLR For prepaid, Telcordia circles Currently in Telcordia circle, HLR provisioning is done manually where in file containing the list of MSISDNs for whom subscription services needs to be activated on HLR is provided to the operations team, i.e. it is a part of operational activity. Considering that the existing approach has the longer provisioning cycle and require manual intervention for provisioning in some of the circles, the following is the unified approach taken for the HLR provisioning for both prepaid and postpaid. To-Be HLR Provisioning Approach For Prepaid In this new approach, subscription engine will push the provisioning request to an EAI layer using XML over JMS which in turn will provide the request to mediation (Comptel IL7) using XML over JMS. Based on the service, Comptel IL7 will fire the corresponding MML commands on the HLR. Subscription engine will fetch the provisioning related information required for HLR provisioning from UUP. Since the data is populated in UUP for subscriber at the lag of one day, subscription engine will fetch the provisioning related parameters from NSMS (BCV dump) in real time. NOTE: In the scenario, if NSMS is not live in certain circles than the provisioning specific parameters will be fetched from HLR view. [pic] For Postpaid (Post-Transformed Scenario) The subscription engine will send the HLR provisioning request to the EAI layer which in turn will provision the subscriber to the requested subscription in BSCS iX which in turn will forward the request to Comptel mediation for HLR provisioning as depicted in figure below. [pic] 2 RIM Provisioning For Prepaid The RIM server provisioning for blackberry services is handled by Comptel IL7 interface where in Comptel IL7 will do the service provisioning first in HLR and than in RIM server. Hence the HLR AND RIM provisioning will fulfilled as a part of single request initiated by subscription engine. Comptel IL7 also maintains the provisioning consistency across HLR and RIM server, i.e. if the provisioning on RIM server fails than Comptel IL7 will also de-provision the service on HLR. [pic] For postpaid (Post-Transformation Scenario) The subscription engine will push the request to EAI layer for provisioning blackberry service to the subscriber on RIM Server. [pic] 3 BSCS iX Provisioning There are scenarios in which BSCS iX provisioning is required pertinent to subscriptions to cater to postpaid charging models. The subscription service can have the various postpaid charging models as mentioned below 1. Monthly rental without pro-rating 2. Monthly rental with pro-rating 3. Advance rental 4. Event charging In the above mentioned scenarios, 1, 2 and 3 requires provisioning in BSCS iX for tagging the requested subscription to the subscriber to cater to the monthly and advance rental charging models. Subscription engine will integrate with EAI layer in async mechanism using XML over JMS for subscription to subscriber provisioning in BSCS iX. EAI layer in turn will forward the request to BSCS iX using XML over JMS which in turn will send the response back to subscription via EAI layer. [pic] 5 Provisioning Layer Subscription engine will initiate the provisioning request after successful charging to the systems/applications (CMS/VAS applications/3rd party content providers) responsible for delivery of the content/service. This will involve the provisioning of subscription service in CMS which is deployed in IDEA SDP ecosystem too. This will also take care of provisioning in postpaid billing system viz. BSCS 6. 1 CMS Provisioning Subscription engine will initiate the subscription provisioning request for a subscriber towards the CMS after successful charging using SOAP over HTTPS protocol where in CMS will expose the standard web service for the following scenarios towards subscription engine. > Purchase subscription > Cancel subscription > Renew subscription 2 VAS applications/3rd part content provider Subscription engine will initiate the subscription provisioning request for a subscriber towards the VAS/3rd part content providers after successful charging using SOAP over HTTPS or HTTPS protocol where in VAS/3rd part content providers will expose the standard interface towards subscription engine. The interface exposed will vary from CP to CP. Hence this will be taken care during the migration of subscription services. 3 BSCS 6 Provisioning There are scenarios in which BSCS 6 provisioning is required pertinent to subscriptions to cater to postpaid charging models. The subscription service can have the various postpaid charging models as mentioned below 1. Monthly rental without pro-rating 2. Monthly rental with pro-rating 3. Advance rental 4. Event charging In the above mentioned scenarios, 1, 2 and 3 requires provisioning in BSCS 6 for tagging the requested subscription to the subscriber to cater to the monthly and advance rental charging models. Subscription engine currently uses IVSM as the provisioning channel to provision the subscription for subscriber in BSCS 6 in async mechanism. The flow for the same is depicted below. [pic] 1) Subscription engine SE will push the provisioning request to the IVSM using DB link which in turn will insert the record in the IVSM database. 2) IVSM component accepts 3 parameters viz. Appsource, Requestcode and circle id, for fulfilling provisioning request. 3) IVSM fetch the details pertinent to BSCS 6 viz. SN code, network type flag, history table name, etc. based on Appsource, Requestcode and circle id. 4) Based on the activation or deactivation request following validations are done by IVSM a. Whether the subscriber is active in BSCS or not b. Requested service is currently inactive for activation request and active for deactivation request c. Whether the service can be assigned under the current rate plan or not 5) After the successful validations, finally IVSM will provision the subscription for the subscriber in to BSCS 6 via ISMS. The same flow will be leveraged in SDP subscription engine solution to provision the subscription for subscriber in BSCS 6. 4 HLR Provisioning (Pre-Transformed Scenario) For Postpaid For postpaid, subscription engine will use the same IVSM channel for HLR provisioning as is used currently. 5 RIM Provisioning For Postpaid (Pre-Transformed Scenario) The subscription will use the same IVSM channel for provisioning the subscriber's blackberry subscription service on RIM server. [pic] 6 BSS Systems Subscription engine will push the generated CDR to the various BSS systems via mediation which is responsible for revenue and subscription status reconciliation, revenue settlement with content partners, postpaid rating & charging and generating the adhoc reports based on SDP subscription engine generated CDRs. The details of the same will be provided in SDP - BSS integration document. The following BSS systems are the consumers of the CDRs 1 Revenue Assurance System Based on the CDRs generated by subscription engine, RA system will generate the various KPI reports like revenue reconciliation, subscription status reconciliation for subscriber, subscription service definition reconciliation, etc. The details of the same will be provided in SDP - BSS integration document. 2 Revenue Settlement System Based on the CDRs generated by subscription engine, RSS will generate the partner settlement report along with the generation of advise. The invoice provided by content provider will be validated against the advise generated by revenue settlement system. 3 Business Intelligence Based on the CDRs generated by subscription engine, BI system will generate the adhoc reports required by IDEA business and technical team for the analytics purpose. Also BI can generate the segments required for campaigns pertinent to subscriptions. 4 Postpaid Billing System The VAS subscription services needs to be tagged to the postpaid subscriber in postpaid billing system having rental based charging. For rental based services, postpaid billing system will do rating and charging but non rental based service SE will generate the pre-rated CDRs which will be provided to postpaid billing system viz. BSCS 6 & iX, via mediation. Based on the transformed CDRs provided by mediation to postpaid billing system, BSCS 6 & iX will do the appropriate charging for each transaction. VAS Subscription services with subscription cycles in multiples of 30 days will be configured in BSCS. All other VAS subscription services whose subscription cycles are less than 30 days, subscription engine will generate the pre-rated CDRs which will be treated as event CDRs in postpaid billing systems. Subsequently, these transactions will be presented in itemized section of subscriber's invoice. The filtering logic will be applied at the mediation end so that the CDRs for rental based charging will not be forwarded to postpaid billing system for rating and charging. 5 Mediation The CDRs generated by Subscription engine will be pushed to the mediation which in turn will forward the as-is CDRs to the downstream BSS systems > Revenue Assurance System > Revenue Settlement System > Business Intelligence But mediation will apply the appropriate filter logic on the CDRs along with it will do the required CDR transformation in the format acceptable by postpaid billing system, viz. BSCS 6 and iX. Note: The details of SE - BSS integration will be captured in a consolidated SDP - BSS integration document once it is finalized. 7 Subscription Engine Subscription engine consist of multiple internal components/modules as mentioned below responsible to form the comprehensive subscription engine solution providing the out of the box capabilities > Discovery Layer > Subscription Engine Core > Service Configuration module > Rating engine module > Reporting engine Module > Logger > Customer Care Module > Monitoring system 1 Discovery layer This layer is responsible for intercepting the request from various channels pertinent to subscriptions i.e. it acts as a request adaptor component with in the subscription engine system. It will expose the subscription engine standard HTTPS interface through which all the channels will forward the request to subscription engine. 2 Subscription Engine Core This forms the heart of the subscription engine wherein it plays a vital role in fulfillment of the subscription specific request handling like activation, deactivation, renewals, grace, suspension, content scheduler, content fetch and deliver, sending notifications, provisioning, rating, initiate charging etc. It has many other internal components as mentioned in the product overview section of this document. 3 Service Configuration The subscription engine administrator can create and configure the subscription service using service configuration web based UI which is an integral module of subscription engine. It has the capabilities to provide the role based access rights to defined sets of users. As a part of subscription service configuration, system administrator can define the basic service definition, rating definition with the corresponding validity and usage, behavior during grace and suspension period definition, configuration of CP URL for provisioning as well as for content fetch and deliver, configuration of notification messages for various events/scenarios and complex business models like combo packs. 4 Rating Engine The subscription engine contains the embedded rating engine module which is responsible for applying the rates to the subscription service requested by subscriber based on the subscriber balance which in turn handles the low and negative balance scenarios in case of prepaid but for postpaid it will impose the base price for the requested subscription service. Based on the rate imposed and the corresponding validity and usage, subscription engine will initiate the provisioning request towards the CMS/VAS applications/3rd party content providers. 5 Reporting Engine The reporting engine module forms the integral part of subscription engine solution which will be responsible for generating standard reports out of the box pertinent to subscription but the adhoc reports will be generated by BI system which currently exists in ICL's eco system. The list of reports which needs to be generated will be provided by ICL's business and technical team stake holders. Also the reporting module has the capability to provide the role based access to the users for generating, viewing and modifying the reports. 6 Logger The subscription engine will have the logging capabilities with various severity levels to log the tasks executed during the fulfillment of subscription request. The following are the types of logs which will be written by subscription engine components. 1) Transaction Logs 2) CDRs (in a predefined format being agreed with Idea) 3) Error Logs 4) Request Logs 5) Debug logs 7 Customer Care Module The subscription engine customer care module will be integrated with the IDEA CRM system using silent login feature which will facilitate the call centre agent to handle customer queries/complaints by view the transactions on customer care screens and can also apply various filters on the different attributes to view the specific transactions. Also it will help call centre agents to place the activation and deactivation orders on behalf of subscribers pertinent to subscriptions. 8 Monitoring Subscription engine components have the capabilities of generating SNMP based alert through the agents deployed on the system where subscription engine components are hosted. It also has capability to define the MIBs which will be accessed using the SNMP protocol. Subscription engine product provides the out of box monitoring system known as net alert. It provides the user friendly dash board which displays the health of the system in real time. Subscription Engine Features The following are the key features of the centralized subscription engine which will be supported for ICL's VAS subscription services. 1) Serve as centralized subscription engine for VAS subscription services in ICL's ecosystem 2) Subscriber's subscriptions life cycle management 3) Conversion of subscription request from different channels in to unified standard format, i.e. subscription engine will expose the standard the interface which will be invoked for any request pertinent to VAS subscriptions. 4) Maintaining the rating definitions and apply the rating based on the balance of the subscriber for all VAS subscription services 5) Initiating the charging request towards IN via UCS for prepaid. 6) Support low balance handling scenarios through various charging models viz. step charging, N-X charging. 7) Initiate the Provisioning request of the subscription service for the subscriber to the following systems - HLR - Postpaid billing system - Internal applications - RIM Server - UCSe - Third party CP's 8) Creation, configuration and administration of subscription services 9) Generation of standard reports pertinent to VAS subscriptions 10) Content fetch and deliver mechanism to facilitate the subscribers query resolution pertinent to content delivery 11) Sending the following types of notifications to the subscribers a.

Rs.4 on activation and Rs.7 on renewal . Configurable renewal logic by time period. E.g. Everyday, every 7 days, every 15 days, every 30 days etc. . Auto renewal or one time charging configuration . Support for Partial Charging , Step Charging and Grace / Suspension Management 5 Subscription/Charging Models One Time Sub Model [pic] Try and Buy Configuration The subscription services can also be offered free for some days in the form of trial period. Once the no of trial days gets exhausted, SE can either send the notification to take the consent from the subscriber OR SE will charge the subscriber for that subscription service based on the service definition configuration. . Configure subscription service Price Point as 0 for the trail period . Configure the number of days after which the trial period expires . Configure the actual Price point of the service to be charged once the trial expires . Configure the number of days after which the warning message is to be sent. [pic] Auto Renewal/Grace Period configuration When the subscription service is configured as auto renewable, based on the validity period the subscriber's subscription will be renewed after successful charging. But if the charging fails while renewing the service, the subscriber's subscription will go under grace period where in subscribers will get the service based on the service configuration. Even if the charging is not successful during the configured grace period, the subscriber's subscription will go under suspension. . Renewal duration is configured to 30 days therefore for each user the renewal date will be after 30 days of start date. . Renewal Message is configured which is sent to the user after renewal is complete. . Grace period parameter in days is also configured inside the XML which specifies the number of days after which the grace period expires. The user is automatically suspended after grace period expires. [pic] Partial Charging The subscription engine will charge the subscriber based on the available balance, i.e. without applying (N-x) charging model. . sub_price: param specifies variable price points configured for the service . sub_endday: param specifies the number of days after which the service will end for each corresponding price point. . sub_warnday: param specifies the number of days after which the warning message will be sent for each corresponding price point. . MT Price point indicates the price points that are immediately billed after sending the Welcome MT. [pic] Trigger Based Charging The charging module can be associated with various triggers that are generated by the system based on the status of the MT sent to a user. The events are configured inside the trigger object created inside the be3a repository under /etc/triggers folder. The triggers can also be configured to operate on certain services only by specifying the matching criteria.

[pic] 1 SANDMAN - DISCOVERY LAYER Sandman is a piece of software that connects B!3A to the telecom operators that use numerous protocols. Sandman uses an asynchronous protocol to interface between a messaging platform (such as B!3A) and the various Telco Operators for processing any kind of message data; mainly Short Message Services and Multimedia Message Services. From an internal point of view we can say that Sandman acts as a gateway, handling a multitude of internal threads to ensure true asynchrony. This gateway can be split into two sides, 'left' and 'right', where the left side corresponds to B!3A interaction and the right side to Telco interaction. This structure can be further broken down into three layers. The bottom layer is the communication layer (corresponding to OSI levels 3 and 4, or the network and transport layers, also called SC). The middle is the codec layer (corresponding to OSI level 5, or the session layer, also called MS). The top layer is the layout layer (called the third level). All functions on levels SC (Serial Connector) and MS (Message Serializer) are provided by plug-ins. There are relatively few SC plug-ins while there are more than 50 different MS plug-ins, covering a plethora of protocols, both standard and proprietary. All input to and output from Sandman takes place on the Communication (SC) Layer. The Serial Connectors are responsible for making connections between Sandman and the external world. All information is sent and received as byte streams. The SC layer is usually split into functional units, the most common being a buffer unit and a protocol unit. This means that bytes can be written to the SC layer in the buffer unit and subsequently passed to the protocol unit to be sent out as a TCP/IP packet once a sufficient number of bytes have been written to the layer. This avoids sending a message for each byte written to the SC layer, which would cause an extremely high number of messages to be sent and congestion in the system. The SC layer is not always necessarily present if the MS layer does not require the functionality provided by the SC layer. The codec or Message Serializer (MS) level handles the actual messages. It draws on an extensive number of protocols to de-serialize and serialize the messages. In other words, it translates bytes into messages and vice versa. Also, it is at this level that messages can be modified and manipulated, if necessary Again, this layer may be broken down into functional units. Finally, the Layout layer, or third level, is where the actual transition from one side of Sandman to another takes place. In other words, it passes messages from the B!3A side of Sandman to the Telco side and vice versa. Since this is where transitions occur, it is also used for housekeeping functions such as counting, filtering and routing. The messages flow back and forth through the system in an asynchronous way - there may be any number of connections on either side. This structure can be represented by the following diagram. [pic] Picture 1 - The Basic Structure of Sandman It is worth noting that there may be many connections for the same short- codes, or one connection for many short-codes. Sandman provides all the flexibility needed to deal with all these Telco-specific problems, completely isolating B!3A (or any other Lside client). 2 BOS - B! CHARGING GATEWAY B.O.S. or BOS is Buongiorno's Online Service for Billing and Subsriptions. BOS Gateway is a platform that allows applications to connect to the external operators billing and subscription services. BOS API is the application to connect to the BOS Gateway. BOS Gateway is the platform and BOS API provides the interface or collection of standard methods to perform transactions though the BOS Gateway. BOS API has been created after considering the integration guides of the Telecommunication Operators with which Buongiorno works, taking into account the methods they require and standardizing them. Applications present in Be3A or a regional application call the methods of BOS API when they need to perform a billing or subscription operation requiring connection with the operator's system. [pic] The application module that requires connecting to the BOS Gateway has an instance of BOS API. Therefore invokes the methods of BOS API. BOS API has been developed to allow the applications to access the BOS Gateway. As an example, the regional team might have an application that contains a method to charge the customers account. This method executes in B!3A which calls the BOS Gateway that connects that local application with the operator with the appropriate protocol. BOS API communicates with the gateway using simple HTTP protocol. BOS API provides a bigger level of abstraction. It is not mandatory to use the API. The other possible ways consist of connecting directly with the gateway and making http requests directly using that connection. An instance of BOS is identified by its URI A URI has been set up for each operator. For example, there is a URI for Telco-Operator1. A Be3a application needing to communicate for billing or subscription purposes with this operator would use the URI setup by BOS for that operator: https://xx.xx.xx.xx:port/bos/<name_of_operator>/ Note that there are various servers for BOS. The instance of BOS API for the Regional or Be3a application would invoke a URI (URL) such as the one above to communicate with the operator for billing or subscription purposes. 3 PREMIUM SERVER - SUBSCRIPTION MANAGER Premium Server is a very important integral component of the Subscription Management Framework. This component takes care of the application logic processing based on the defined rules of the service. All the Subscription Services logic resides with Premium Server. As far as B! is concerned, a service is far more complex. Services are based on -pull-push strategies as illustrated below. [pic] Mobile Originated messages (hereafter referred to as MO) are messages that arrive from a handset, whereas Mobile Terminated messages (hereafter referred to as MT) are ones that finish on a consumer's mobile device. Services are accessed by consumers using service numbers, most of the time these are shortcodes. Shortcodes are telephone numbers of four or five digits provided by Operators in order to provide services with numbers that are easy to remember. The consumer sends a short message with a keyword, code or a known syntax text to the shortcode number. Hence, the platform receives a known subset of messages which require routing through the system to direct the message to the correct service or application. Accordingly, depending on the service itself, one or more service components may be operational. Furthermore, one or more instances could exist in order to maximize performance, but this is not apparent from the point of view of consumers. By _instance', we mean an entire implementation of the Premium Services Framework. Finally, we can say that the service is the minimal unit for accounting and billing purposes. The Client is the entity that requests the creation and implementation of services for consumers. These may range from mobile telecom operators, companies wishing to launch a product or promote existing ones and even B! itself. A helpful distinction is that each service belongs to one client but a client may have many services. Furthermore, the client is defined in terms of billing or revenue share for the services, so several logical clients can exist for the same physical client (entity) to aid billing. A list of valid clients is defined in a standard DTD. Finally, we need to make a distinction between single message services and multi message services. Single message services are the classic services that most consumers are familiar with. Its response depends purely on the MO sent by the consumer. An example would be the downloading of a service using one message only. Multi message services, on the other hand, are far more interactive and also more complex in terms of routing. The response to the consumer's MO is dependent on previous interactions between the consumer and the system itself. This means that it is necessary to generate and store user states that can be used as identifiers for incoming MOs and so monitor the progress of the consumer through the steps of the multi-part message. An example of this would be a trivia quiz game where question and answer messages bounce back and forth between the consumer and the system. Identical MOs can generate different responses depending on the previous state generated by the process. The diagram below is an illustration of this idea [pic] Here we can clearly see that identical MOs, in this case -a|, generate different responses from the system. The system records the user's state and processes subsequent messages based on it. It then modifies the state, once the message has been processed and the response sent, in order to be ready to process the next MO in a correct manner. The Premium Services Framework architecture has been specifically designed to handle the complex routing demands made by multi-messages. To do this, the framework has been streamlined, breaking down processes into sub-sets of common tasks handled by dedicated components. 4 ENGINE SMS (RENEWALS, MESSAGE DELIVERY) Push services engine is the component that produces any messages associated to a list and scheduled to be sent using the B!3A standard list and message interface. This engine is also known as _scheduler engine' or _jmailer engine', although jmailer engines do not process scheduled messages. This section will describe the complete process from production to delivery. The delivery procedure, after messages are produced, is common to all applications, simply by changing the producer application to another (such as premium). The following diagram shows the flow of the messages starting from the database, where they are stored after being created for scheduling, to the XMS gateway (sandman). Route queues and processes are shared by all applications that need to deliver messages using that route. All other components are often configured to process one or more countries. A group of countries is known as region for management purposes. Using independent queues and components for each region or country provides isolation between them. Only the use of shared resources such as system shared resources or shared routes in one region can affect the delivery/production in other regions. Every step or component configures the resources it uses, so more resources can be allocated wherever needed. 5 The Scheduler The scheduler is the component that acquires messages and users from the database and injects the resulting jobs to be processed in the delivery queues. All lists in B!3A need to be assigned to a cluster. The cluster is a name for a group of scheduler nodes. Each cluster will be attended by one or more nodes. Each node is configured to process messages from one or more clusters. Every _push services engine' can have one or more scheduling nodes. Every node is configured to produce jobs for a region. The scheduler will periodically iterate over the list of countries to fetch any messages pending to be produced. A node can contain a _pre/post module executer'. A Pre-scheduling module is a software component associated to a message that will be executed before the users are fetched from the list and any other production tasks. A Post-scheduling module is a software component associated to a message that will be executed after a message is produced (some final user messages may be delivered by that time, but it is not granted to be called after delivery, but after production). The _pre/post module executer' thread will execute the module and notify the main producer when finished. Execution will be aborted if the timeout configured expires (often 30 minutes). Slow modules have been confirmed to delay deliveries in the lists that have this module associated to their deliveries. The following schema shows the procedure: [pic] As you can see, In-scheduler/Single-scheduling modules are directly executed by the scheduler. In the scheduler part, the main component detects messages to be produced and signs them with the node identifier. Once the message is ready, it queries the list to obtain the users that will receive it. It will produce jobs, containing blocks of users (often +5000) and referencing the message to be delivered. The jobs are inserted into the splitter queues, which is the entry point of the delivery procedure. 6 CRON SERVER (SCHEDULER) CRON is the name of a program that enables users to execute commands or scripts (groups of commands) automatically at a specified time/date; it is where all timed events are initiated. On the B!3A platform, CRON jobs are used to execute application modules at a predetermined moment in time. The CRON is a daemon, which means that it only needs to be started once, and will then lie dormant until it is required. The CRON daemon -wakes up| every minute and examines all the stored configuration files, called crontabs, to check each of them for commands that may have been scheduled to be executed at the current time. 7 Component Functionalities First time Activation Flow [pic] 1 B! Gateway SANDMAN, B!'s propriety solution, is the Internal Gateway of the B!3A platform which processes inbound SMS requests and out bound MT pushes form the platform. It supports all major connectivity protocols such as SMPP, HTTP, CIMD etc. and is used for SMS, MMS or WAP pushes. 2 Processor The Application processor is the component that defines logics & actions for a keyword received via the Gateway. In the case of subscriptions it routes the relevant keywords towards the Subscription module. 3 Subscription module This component is the core of the Subscription Manager and manages all information related to the subscription service of a particular user based on defined business logics, such as: . Service activated . Activation date . Last billed date . Renewal date . Deactivation date It also processes activation / deactivation requests for all services and can also support a 'Check' feature for customer to know their existing active subscription services. 4 Charging Manager The Billing Manager is responsible to bill users for service activation and renewal, by integrating with the operators billing mechanism/system. 5 Database / CMS All information related to the user is stored in the form of lists, this includes storage of the following in the respective service list: . Activation date . Last billed date . Renewal date . Deactivation date The CMS stores the content in the Database or fetches them from external 3rd party URLs. 6 Delivery Engine Responsible for content delivery, the Delivery Engine receives the request from the subscription module and accordingly pushes the content. Subscriber User Content Delivery Flow [pic] Additional components utilized during content delivery, not described above, are as follows: 1 Cron Cron is an application layer that triggers events, such as when to send a content push. It invokes the subscription module for processing. 2 Subscriber List The Subscriber Lists are tables within the database which store all information related to the user. Each subscription service has a unique list and within these lists, subscriber information is stored. Subscription Engine Use cases for Prepaid 1 Subscription service via the discovery channels Subscriber can request for the subscription service via different discovery channels. Viz. SMS, MMS, IVR, WAP, USSD, WEB, SD/Customer Care /Sanchaya (Out Dialler Call Centre) Interface, Retail (VTOP Up's), black berry, app store, STK & DSTK etc. The request is forwarded to the Subscription engine which has a request intercepting layer which will intercept the multi lingual request from multiple bearers and transforms the request in to the unified format accepted by subscription engine. 1 Subscription Activation through SMS [pic] .

Any request for renewal of the service would be treated as a new request. There are different scenarios in which the subscription service can be in the deactivation mode:- 1. Suspension mode to deactivate mode: - As discussed in the previous use case. If the subscriber fails to renew the subscription service within the suspension period, the subscription service status is changed to deactivation. The subscription engine deactivates the service to the subscriber and updates its database with the deactivation status. 2. Opt in Deactivation:-If the subscriber explicitly requests (opts) for the deactivation of the subscription service, the Subscription engine deactivates the subscription service for the subscriber. 1 OPT IN Deactivation of the subscription [pic] . Subscriber sends the subscription service deactivation request via SMS on a short code and keyword to Messaging gateway which in turn will forward the request to subscription engine. . Subscription Engine would do the follow validations:- o Deactivation request syntax is valid or not o Subscriber is already subscribed to the requested service or not o Subscription Engine would send an acknowledgement to the subscriber. . Subscription Engine sends the subscription service deprovisioning request to the application for subscriber. . Subscription Engine will update the deactivation status of the subscription service for the subscriber in its database. . Subscription Engine generates a CDR for this process. . SE will update the subscriber's subscription status as deactivated in UUP . Subscription Engine will send the successful deactivation of subscription notification to the subscriber 6 Business Models for the subscription The subscriber can request for a subscription service via various discovery channels. The subscription engine validates the request and then apply rate for the subscription service .Subscription Engine would fetch the subscription definition which includes rating information for requested service and hit the IN via UCS to fetch the balance of the subscriber. There are various business model applied for deciding the rate of the subscription service:- o Step charging o Micro charging o Trigger charging. The subscription engines apply rating rules on the service by using the following parameters:- o Subscriber balance. o Rating information for requested service. o Calculates the charging amount for the subscription service by using N- x formula , where N =Balance of the subscriber , x= Threshold limit Depending on the subscribers balance, the SE decides the charging rate for the subscription and initiates the charging request towards IN via UCS. Step charging :- For the subscription service, a set of step charging rate is available. Depending on the subscribers balance, the step charge value is decided. Example: - For the news subscription, the base rate for the News subscription is Rs.30/-.The subscription Engine defines 4 step charging as follows:- |SL.No | Rate |No.of Days valid|Alerts | |1 |30 |30 |30 | |2 |20 |20 |20 | |3 |10 |10 |10 | |4 |5 |5 |5 | Depending on the balance of the subscriber, the step charge is decided as explained below:- o Case 1:- If the subscribers balance is Rs. 35 , Threshold value is Rs.5 , Then charging amount is 35-5 =30 ; So the SE will opt for the 1st rate ie RS 30/-.So the subscription service will be available for 30 days with 30 alerts. o Case 2:-If the subscribers balance is Rs. 22 , Threshold value is Rs.5 , Then charging amount is 22-5 =17 ; So the SE will opt for the 2st rate ie RS 10/-. So the subscription service will be available for 10 days with 10 alerts. o Case 3:-If the subscribers balance is Rs. 6 , Threshold value is Rs.5 , Then charging amount is 6-5 =1 ; the SE doesn't have any step charge defined for this amount .So SE will not activate the subscription service Micro Charging :- Subscription Engine would fetch the subscription definition which includes rating information for requested service and fetch the balance of the subscriber. If the subscriber has a low balance, the subscription engine uses the N-x formula to compute the subscription/charging rate of the service, where N =Balance of the subscriber, x= Threshold limit. Example:- The subscriber has a balance of Rs.15/- and as per TRAI regulation, the threshold limit is Rs.3/- Then the subscription Engine will deduct RS.12/- (15-3 ie N-x) as the subscription charges. Trigger charging: - This is an event based subscription service request. Ex: - subscription for world cup. The subscription engine uses the N-x formula to compute the subscription/charging rate of the service, where N =Balance of the subscriber, x= Threshold limit. Example:- The subscription service rate is RS.30/-. The subscriber has a balance of Rs.15/- and as per TRAI regulation, the threshold limit is Rs.3/- Subscription Engine will deduct RS.12/- (15-3 i.e. N-x)as the subscription charges and provide the service for configured no. of days. 1 Step charging [pic] .

Subscription Engine would send the request acknowledgement to the subscriber. . Subscription engine will hit the IN via UCS to fetch the balance of the subscriber. . The subscription engine apply rating rules on the service by using the following parameters - o Subscriber balance. o Rating information for requested combo service. o Calculates the charging amount for the subscription service by using N- x formula , where N =Balance of the subscriber , x= Threshold limit . Depending on the subscribers balance, the SE decides the subscription rate to be implemented and initiates the charging request towards IN via UCS. . The combo pack has more than 1 service available. Each service has a specific usage available for specific valid period. The distribution of alerts and validity to the users will be according to the user's balance and price & validity matrix configured in combo service definition. For example.- Assume a combo pack has a combination of Jokes and astro .The various step charge available is as follows:- 1. Charged price is RS. 45 for 3 Jokes alert and 2 astro alert, validity 30 days for joke and 20 days for astro 2. Charged price is RS. 40 for 3 Jokes alert and 2 astro alert, validity 25 days for joke and 15 days for astro . On successful charging, the subscription engine sends subscription service provisioning request for the available services as a part of combo pack with their respective validity period data and usage related information to the respective applications. If subscription service provisioning fails, do a credit back of money, if supported. Else mark the record for manual reconciliation. . Write audit logs in the form of CDR for charging transaction and EDR for event based processing. . Send SMS notification to the user with the configured message. . Updates the subscription service status in SDP UUP component to assign the subscription service to the subscriber. Scenario for Renewal:- The renewals will be executed according to the priority defined in the combo definition. The lower priority service will be renewed only when the higher priority service in the combo is renewed, i.e. renewal will be based on longest running service. The validity and content alerts distribution is according to the matrix configured in the single services and not the combo definition. User will be activated to the combo if the user balance belongs to any of the steps defined in the combo definition matrix, if the users balance is less than the last step defined in the matrix then user will be denied of the service. The distribution of usage and validity to the user is also according to the user's balance and price & validity matrix definition of the combo. If the user is already subscribed to one of the single services that are part of combo that will have no effect on the activation of combo and the user will receive alerts from both combo and already subscribed single service. Assuming the combo pack has 2 services. ComboSubPack-1 with Content Validity X and ComboSubPack-2 with Content Y Validity i.e. combo sub pack 1 has higher priority than combo sub pack 2, then depending on the balance of the subscriber, Combo sub pack1 will be renewed for a higher subscription rate Example:- Rates for combo sub pack1:- 1. Rs 45. for 3 alerts , validity 30 days 2. Rs.40 , 3 alerts , validity 20 days 3. Rs 35 , 2 alerts , validity 15 days Rates for combo pack 2:- 1. Rs 30 , for 3 alerts , validity 15 days 2. Rs.20 , 2 alerts , validity 10 days 3. Rs 10 , 2 alerts , validity 5 days If the subscriber has renewed for Rs 60/- , as combo sub pack 1 has higher priority, so it will be renewed with higher amount and combo sub pack renewed with the balance amount. Combo sub pack1 is renewed for Rs.45 and combo sub pack 2 will be renewed for Rs.10 only (Rs. 60 -Rs 45 = Rs.15. the step charge is valid for Rs 10/-) . The subscription engine checks the priority of the service sub pack1 and service sub pack 2. If the service pack 1 is the higher priority pack then it is renewed first. Else if the pack is lower priority service, then it will be renewed only when the higher priority service in the combo is renewed. . Subscription Engine fetches the record of the subscriber for renew pack1. . Subscription engine will hit the IN via UCS to fetch the balance of the subscriber. . The subscription engine apply rating rules on the service by using the following parameters - o The subscriber balance. o The rating information for requested service. o Calculates the charging amount for the subscription service by using N- x formula , where N =Balance of the subscriber , x= Threshold limit . Depending on the subscribers balance, the higher priority sub pack gets the highest amount renewed and the lower priority sub pack gets the balance. . On successful charging, the subscription engine sends subscription service provisioning request for the available services as a part of combo pack with their respective validity period data and usage related information to the respective applications. If subscription service provisioning fails, do a credit back of money, if supported. Else mark the record for manual reconciliation. . Do callback, if configured, with MSISDN, action, status, amount charged, next charging date. . Write audit logs in the form of CDR for charging transaction and EDR for event based processing. .

Subscription Engine would fetch the subscriber's profile from SDP UUP. o Subscriber type o Circle o Status o Subscriber segment o Ported In / Out . Subscription Engine would fetch the subscription definition which includes rating information for requested service . Subscription Engine will do the following subscription specific validations based on subscriber profile like o Whether the subscriber is ported out subscriber. o Whether the subscriber belongs to prepaid or post paid. o Whether the subscriber is eligible or belongs to the category for which this subscription service has been offered. o Whether the subscriber is black listed. o Check the status (viz. Active, Suspend, Inactive) of subscriber. o Whether the requested subscription service exist for that subscriber's circle or not. o Whether the requested subscription services need to be offered to the particular LOB of the subscriber's or not. o Whether the requested subscription service have been discovered via valid channel or not. . Subscription Engine checks the subscriber's status in the UUP. If the status is active, it would continue with the process of rating & charging. . Subscription Engine would send the request acknowledgement to the subscriber. . Subscription engine pushes the request in to IVSM DB for provisioning by inserting the request in to IVSM master table. . IVSM forwards the request for provisioning to BSCS 6 via the ISMS. . BSCS 6 tags the requested subscription service to the subscriber and notifies the subscription engine with a successful message. . On successful provisioning in BSCS 6, it will impose the charging for the service as per the service rating definition. . On successful provisioning in BSCS 6, the subscription engine sends service provisioning request to the application. . Do callback, if configured, with MSISDN, action, status, amount charged, next charging date. . Write audit logs in the form of CDR for charging transaction and EDR for event based processing. . Send SMS notification to the user with the configured message. . Updates the subscription service status in SDP UUP component to assign the subscription service to the subscriber. 2 Subscriber's Status - Suspend [pic] . Subscriber request for text based subscription purchase request via SMS to Messaging gateway. . Subscription request would be forwarded to Subscription Engine . Subscription Engine would do the follow validations o Requested Service is valid or not o Application specific parameters or service tokens are valid o Subscriber is already subscribed to the requested service or not . Subscription Engine would fetch the subscriber's profile from SDP UUP. o Subscriber type o Circle o Status o Subscriber segment o Ported In / Out . Subscription Engine would fetch the subscription definition which includes rating information for requested service . Subscription Engine will do the following subscription specific validations based on subscriber profile like o Whether the subscriber is ported out subscriber. o Whether the subscriber belongs to prepaid or post paid. o Whether the subscriber is eligible or belongs to the category for which this subscription service has been offered. o Whether the subscriber is black listed. o Check the status (viz. Active, Suspend, Inactive) of subscriber. o Whether the requested subscription service exist for that subscriber's circle or not. o Whether the requested subscription services need to be offered to the particular LOB of the subscriber's or not. o Whether the requested subscription service have been discovered via valid channel or not. . Subscription Engine checks the subscriber's status in the UUP. If the status is suspend than the subsequent action has to be taken. . Subscription engine will push the request in to retry bucket where in subscription engine will try to process the request once in a day for configurable number of days . If the retry is successful than subscription engine will process the request further for rating and charging. . If the retry is unsuccessful with in configured number of days than SE will send the acknowledgement back to the subscriber with an appropriate message for not processing the request. NOTE: UUP will identify the subscriber whose status gets changed from Active to Suspend and will tag the same in separate table. Script will be executed once in a day to poll the tagged status changed from UUP. This in turn will invoke the API exposed by the subscription engine which in turn will take the appropriate action. In case of blackberry, if the subscriber is in Suspend state, then 2 scenarios exist. 1) For existing blackberry subscribers, subscription engine will initiate the blackberry service suspension request for the subscriber towards HLR and RIM server. 2) For the fresh blackberry activation request from the subscriber, subscription engine will deny the request to the subscriber. 3 Subscriber's Status - Inactive A subscriber's status can be inactive under the following scenario:- 1. Subscriber has ported out / deactivated:-The subscriber has requested for the service and due to some reason the request is stored in the retry queue/ bucket. In the mean time, the subscriber has ported out / deactivated. So when the request is retrieved from the retry bucket, the status of the subscriber is already inactive. 2. The request is stored in the bulk. [pic] . Subscriber request for the service is stored in the retry queue/ bucket. The request is retrieved and forwarded to Subscription Engine . Subscription Engine would do the follow validations o Subscriber is already subscribed to the requested service or not . Subscription Engine would fetch the subscriber's profile from SDP UUP. o Subscriber type o Circle o Status o Subscriber segment o Ported In / Out . Subscription Engine will do the following subscription specific validations based on subscriber profile like o Whether the subscriber is ported out subscriber. o Whether the subscriber belongs to prepaid or post paid. o Whether the subscriber is eligible or belongs to the category for which this subscription service has been offered. o Whether the subscriber is black listed. o Check the status (viz. Active, Suspend, Inactive) of subscriber. o Whether the requested subscription service exist for that subscriber's circle or not. o Whether the requested subscription services need to be offered to the particular LOB of the subscriber's or not. o Whether the requested subscription service have been discovered via valid channel or not. . Subscription Engine checks the subscriber's status from UUP. If the status is inactive, Subscription Engine generates an EDR for event based processing. . Subscription Engine logs the response in a file. Scenario 2:- Bulk request . Subscriber request for the service is stored in the bulk. The request is retrieved from the queue i.e. fetch one record at a time and forwarded to Subscription Engine . Subscription Engine would do the follow validations o Requested Service is valid or not o Application specific parameters or service tokens are valid o Subscriber is already subscribed to the requested service or not .

Subscription Engine checks the subscriber's status from UUP. If the status is inactive, subscription Engine generates an EDR for event based processing. . Subscription Engine logs the response in a file. Integration The Subscription Engine performs the following integrations to carry out some of the major tasks 1 UUP Integration This is performed by Subscription Engine to find out different parameters of a Subscriber Profile e.g. to find out if a subscriber is post-paid or pre-paid, to which circle the subscriber belongs, subscriber segment and category etc. These parameters may be used to determine appropriated charging and provisioning interfaces to be used for a particular service for a subscriber. Also, the subscription Engine will update UUP with subscribers' subscription profile. Subscription engine will be integrated with UUP using JDBC connectivity along with thin driver which provides efficient performance. 1 Fetch subscriber profile Subscription fetches the following information from UUP during the fulfillment of subscription request. [pic] In scenario, when UUP is down or unable to connect to UUP or subscriber profile not found in UUP, subscription engine will hit the IN via UCS to fetch the balance and if the UCS returns subscriber not found error than the subscriber is treated as postpaid else the subscriber will be treated as prepaid. 2 Update subscription Profile Subscription engine will insert and update the following attributes as a subscriber's subscription profile in UUP for following scenarios. > Activation > Renewal > Grace > Suspension Note: In subscription deactivation scenario, record will be deleted from UUP containing subscription for a subscriber. [pic] Based on the type of subscription request, following parameters will be updated as a part of subscriber's subscription profile in UUP. 1 Case I: Subscription Activation During subscription activation, record will be inserted in to UUP SERVICE_ITEM TABLE populating following attributes MSISDN_NUMBER SERVICE_ID SERVICE_NAME ACTIVATION_DATE SERVICE_ITEM_STATUS SOURCE_SYSTEM LAST_MODIFIED_DATE (internally updated by UUP DB) 2 Case II: Subscription Renewal During subscription renewal, record will be updated in to UUP SERVICE_ITEM TABLE with following attributes LAST_RENEWAL_DATE LAST_MODIFIED_DATE (internally updated by UUP DB) 3 Case III: Subscription Grace When the subscriber's subscription status gets changed from active to grace, record will be updated in to UUP SERVICE_ITEM TABLE with following attributes SERVICE_ITEM_STATUS STATUS_CHANGE_DATE LAST_MODIFIED_DATE (internally updated by UUP DB) 4 Case IV: Subscription Suspension When the subscriber's subscription status gets changed from grace to suspension, record will be updated in to UUP SERVICE_ITEM TABLE with following attributes SERVICE_ITEM_STATUS STATUS_CHANGE_DATE LAST_MODIFIED_DATE (internally updated by UUP DB) 2 UCS Integration Subscription engine will integrate with UCS in real time for prepaid using HTTPS protocol exposed by UCS. This will enable subscription engine to check pre-paid subscriber balance amount and also to charge /refund /block the amount of a subscriber. The balance check is mandatory check for all subscriptions as after this all low and negative balance handling related charging features can be applied. The following are the set of charging parameters which needs to be sent to the UCS by subscription engine during URL invocation. |S# |Parameter |Data |Max |Description |Get Balance| | | |Type |Length|

following actions. 1 Case I: Request parameter missing error In this scenario, subscription engine will not retry but will send the subscription request purchase failure notification to the end subscriber. 2 Case II: Operation failed In this scenario, subscription engine will not retry but will send the subscription request purchase failure notification to the end subscriber. 3 Case III: Connection Time out In this scenario, subscription engine log this request in to the file and will be reconciled manually with IN. If the subscriber has been charged, than subscription provisioning for subscriber will be done offline else that request will be pushed in retry bucket. 4 Case IV: Unable to connect to UCS In this scenario, subscription engine will try to charge for configured number of retries. Subsequently, even if charging fails, SE will push the request in to retry bucket. 5 Case V: Allocation Failed In this scenario, subscription engine will try to charge for configured number of retries. Subsequently, even if charging fails, SE will push the request in to retry bucket. 3 Integration with BSCS 6 and BSCS iX The subscription engine will integrate with BSCS 6 and iX to provision the subscription service for the subscriber. Subsequently BSCS 6 and iX will maintain do the rating and charging for monthly and advance rental. 1 BSCS 6 Integration Subscription engine will use IVSM as the provisioning channel for tagging the subscription request to the subscriber in BSCS 6. Subscription engine will push the request to IVSM using DB link which in turn will insert the request in to IVSM master table. IVSM fetch the request from the table one by one and process the request by doing certain validations and subsequently provisioning the subscriber in BSCS 6 via ISMS. Once the subscriber is provisioned, ISMS will insert the response in to IVSM history table which is specific to each service where in SE will pull the response from that table. The structure of the IVSM master table and IVSM history table is same as provided below. IVSM Master Table & IVSM History Table |Field Names | |TRXID | |APPSOURCE | |REQUESTCODE | |MOBILENO | |CIRCLEID | |REQUESTFLAG | |REQUESTDATE | |STATUS | |REJECTCODE | |PROCESSDATE | |LOADDATE | |CUSTCODE | |CO_ID | |BILLCYCLEDATE | |PROCESSID | |REJECTIONDESCRIPTION | 2 BSCS iX integration Subscription engine will use EAI layer as a provisioning layer to provision the subscription for subscriber in BSCS iX. Subscription engine will push the BO (Business Object) which is in the form of XML to EAI layer using XML over JMS which in turn will send the request to BSCS iX for provisioning using XML over JMS. 4 Messaging Gateway Integration Subscription engine will integrate with messaging gateway using SOAP over HTTPS interface exposed by the messaging gateway. This will enable subscription engine to receive subscription specific request (MO) discovered via SMS, USSD and STK channel, also subscription engine will be to send the notifications or content to the subscribers (MT). The subscription engine will receive the MO in the format as illustrated below.

These CDR files will be pushed to the mediation at a frequency of every 2 hours using SFTP protocol through scripts running on the servers of subscription engine component generating CDRs. Mediation in turn will forward these CDR file to BSS downstream systems, viz. BSCS 6 & iX, RSS, RA & BI. The following attached spread sheet captures IDEA SDP CDR Specification pertinent to subscriptions. 8 CRM Integration The customer care module of subscription engine will be integrated with IDEA unified customer care using silent login feature to handle the customer queries and complaints. The CSR will seamlessly login in to from unified CRM in to subscription engine customer care module. The subscription engine customer care module will expose the HTTPS based standard interface which will be invoked by IDEA CRM to embed the screens in it. The minimum parameters that will be required by SM customer care module as mentioned below will be passed by unified CRM for seamless login. V MSISDN V USER ID V PASSWORD V CIRCLE ID Solution Benefits The following are the benefits pertinent to subscription engine solution 1) Easy integration with the subscription engine using the standard interface exposed by the subscription engine. 2) It will provide the unified view of the subscriber pertinent to subscription services which are being currently provided by the various vendors in isolated manner for the set of subscription services they are offering. 3) Unified view of subscriber pertinent to subscription will enable business to target the specific set of subscribers for VAS subscription specific campaigns. 4) Based on the CDR generated by subscription engine, IDEA will be able to do the revenue settlement with content partners in precise manner which will eliminate any disputes with the content partners 5) Unified approach for HLR provisioning across all the circles for prepaid and postpaid 6) Subscription engine will have the capability to fetch the balance of the subscriber and than initiate the charging request. This will avoid multiple charge request to INs providing performance optimization 7) Subscription engine will provide the fetch and deliver mechanism of the content to subscriber leading to quality of service (QoS) for the subscriber. Also it will facilitate to resolve the customers queries and complaints for the content not being delivered to the subscriber. 8) Centralized customer care to provide the unified view of the subscription transactions of a particular subscriber since currently independent vendor's customer care module is integrated with IDEA CRM. 9) Consolidate reports pertinent to VAS subscriptions to business and technical team using reporting module of subscription engine. 10) Based on the CDR generated by subscription engine, BI will be able to generate the adhoc reports pertinent to subscriptions Reporting The subscription engine logs all the transactions in to the embedded persistent database. This database is in real time sync with the reporting engine database so that there is no impact on the subscription engine performance while generating the reports. The subscription engine constitutes of reporting module which has the user friendly dash board to generate the standard reports by applying certain filters required by business and technical team. It not only displays the reports on the dash board but also has the flexibility to save the reports in excel format on to that system. But there are some adhoc reports which will be generated by the BI system based on the CDRs generated by subscription component. The illustrative sets of reports with screen shots provided by the Subscription Manager framework are provided below. USER V/S SUSBCRIPTION SERVICES REPORT The following report provides the user wise services status. This reporting interface also provides the feature to customer care agent to either subscribe / unsubscribe the user from respective services allowed for the user. [pic] DETAILED SERVICE STATUS REPORT The following report shows list of services and subscription status of the user. [pic] ACTIVATE SUBSCRIPTION The following report helps in activating the subscription of the user. [pic] SUBCRIPTION ACTIVATED The following screen shows the subscription activation status. [pic] SUBSCRIPTION DEACTIVATED The following screen shows the subscription deactivation status. [pic] DELIVERED MESSAGES REPORT The following report shows the complete detail of the messages pushed from the platform and their delivery status. [pic] [pic] MOBILE TRAFFIC SUMMARY REPORT The following report shows the details of MO/MT transactions per MSISDN. [pic] Logging The Subscription Manager Framework has an inbuilt logging mechanism. The subscription engine components will be responsible for generating various kinds of logs viz. transaction logs, error logs, request logs, debug logs. The log levels range between 0-9. The following matrix shows the log level and the kind of log information written by the subscription engine components. |Log Level|Information | |0 |No Logs | |1 |Very less and lightest logs. | |2 |Generic Information, Application Specific Information, | | |any specific information traces. | |3 |Error Log Messages( Recommended ) | |4 |Warning Messages. This is the default log level. | |5 |Statistical Messages | |6 |Hint Log Messages and Debug Log Messages | |9 |Debug Log Messages | On the production deployment it's recommended to set log level to 4 which will print the error log messages which are required to trace on the error scenarios and issues. Customer Care The subscription manager framework provide out of box customer care module which enables call centre agents to handle customer queries and complaints. The call centre agent can view the subscription information pertinent to subscriber by applying search filter on various parameters. This customer care module will be integrated with the IDEA CRM using silent login feature. The following are the features which will be provided by customer care module of subscription engine. > Access Control List > Role based responsibilities > Ability to V View Transaction status against MSISDN V Activate subscription service for a MSISDN V De-Activate subscription service V View transaction history against MSISDN / Transaction identifier > Perform search operation V MSISDN wise V Service wise V Date wise > Content fetch and deliver information V MSISDN to which content was delivered V Date and time of delivery of content V Status of delivery of content > Ability to credit / refund the subscriber in case subscription provisioning fails. NOTE: Role based access control rights will also be imposed on operation/action levels like activation and deactivation. The subscription engine customer care screens will provide information (sample parameters provided below) pertinent to subscriptions assigned to the subscriber as shown in screens shot. Sample Parameter 1. Subscriber MSISDN 2. Subscriber Type 3. Subscription service assigned to the subscriber 4. Request Date 5. Activation Date 6. Renewal Date 7. Deactivation Date 8. Expiry Date 9. Activation Bearer 10. Deactivation Bearer 11. Subscription status 12. Charge status 13. Last activation date 14. Service description / details 15. Subscription pack name 16. Circle 17. Prepaid / Postpaid 18. Provider 19. Transaction identifier 20. Auto renewable 21. Price Point [pic] Also it should provide the view of the transactions for the content delivered to the subscriber by subscription engine in fetch and deliver scenario. [pic] Traffic projection The following are the traffic projections provided by IDEA for VAS subscriptions. [pic] The details of the VAS subscription volumetric are provided in attached spreadsheet. [pic] Bandwidth Calculation The bandwidth calculation pertinent to VAS subscriptions are captured in attached spread sheet. [pic] For content fetch and deliver scenario, additional 0.5 MBPS of bandwidth will be required. Deployment Architecture [pic] Back-up & Recovery This section provides an overview of backup & maintenance process. Further, it details the encompassing inputs, process, outputs, responsibilities & authorities and other related Activities for this. The purpose of this policy is as follows: . To prevent the loss of data in the case of an accidental deletion or corruption of data or system failure. . To permit timely restoration of information and data, should such events occur. 1 Backup Components Subscription Engine components for which backup will be performed is: 1. Main Database Servers > Configuration Tables - Fortnightly > Service Routing Tables - Daily and Fortnightly > Transactional Tables - Daily and Fortnightly 2. Split Database Servers > Subscriber List Tables - Daily 3. Application Server (JHUB) > Conf & bin folders - CVS Backup > Lib and Classes folders - Fortnightly and as and when upgraded > logs - Daily 2 Backup Frequency Main Database Servers Daily Backups - Backups will be performed from the reporting or the mirror servers. Every day during off peak hours, a backup_db_daily.sh script will take the backup of all transactional tables since last to last full backups and put the same on a backup folder overwriting the data backup taken on the previous day. The Daily transactional tables are:- > MO Tables > MT Tables > BOS Billing Tables > CDR BOS Tables > Service Routing Tables > www and wwwsum Tables Most of above tables are Daily tables or updated regularly. These tables will be backed up on daily basis starting from the day on which the last to last fortnightly full backup was taken. Fortnightly Backups - Backups will be performed from the reporting or the mirror servers. Every fortnight a full backup will be done using backup_db_fort.sh script that will take the full backup, compress it and put it into a backup location. The script can be configured to keep previous certain copies of the data. Split Database Servers Daily Backup - Split databases are meant for storing subscriber specific information and updated daily or as per the associated service design. Therefore, a full backup will be performed on each split database server holding the subscriber list and associated information on daily basis using script ""backup_splitdb_daily.sh"". Application Servers (JHUB) Jhub Conf Backup - The conf folder contains all the necessary configuration files for running jhubs. Any changes to these files will also be committed on the CVS. Since the changes are not frequent CVS backup would be taken on daily basis and last 5 copies would be maintained. Jhub libraries and classes folder - Fortnightly or as and when changed. The libraries are static hence would be taken on fortnightly basis or after the change. Daily Logs Backup - A daily script will be configured to run every mid- night which will compress the previous day logs from the logs folder and put the same at a backup location. 3 Backups Verification On a daily basis, logged information generated from each backup job will be reviewed for the following purposes > To check for and correct errors. > To monitor the duration of the backup job. > To optimize backup performance where possible. > Random test restores will be done once every fortnight in order to verify that backups have been successful.

INTRODUCTION This document is designed to provide a detailed overview of Prepaid Post-paid Online churn functionality. 1 Purpose of this document The requirement is to accept prepaid customer's churn request online via EAI queue and before deleting the active services, check prepaid/post-paid flag/indicator at SE end. For post-paid customer accept request as current mechanism (via post-paid EAI queue) and before deleting active services compare date-time stamp of active service with received date-time stamp. Purpose of this document is to indicate the points where these new changes in the SE system/configuration will happen to implement the above mentioned requirement. 2 Scope of this document Scope of the document is to provide the design overview for the above said requirement, system areas which get affected during the implementation of the change, detailed changes for the new configuration flow and the design architecture for the current and the new change flow. 3 References [pic][pic] Design Overview New multithreaded consumer will be developed to receive prepaid online churn feed from EAI, which will consume messages from prepaid EAI queue and execute validations before deleting active services. In existing post-paid consumer extra validations for date-time stamp will be implemented. 1 Current Process In current process, SE_Daily cron fetches churn request from UUP's se_daily table. For churn records, SE fetches only those records for which SE_PROCESSED=0 and CHURN = 1 select msisdn,pre2post,post2pre,a2g,g2a,a2s,s2a,churn,simchg,old_sim,new_sim,e ventdt,se_processed,hlr_id,circle,prepaid_flag,imsi from UUP.SE_DAILY where (CHURN='1' or SIMCHG='1') and SE_PROCESSED='0' limit <endlimit> A csv file getting created by SE_daily module for selected records and placed in configured location. File read and processed by the inoticoming process to create bos tickets. These tickets get processed by the SE_Daily BOS instance and called the ChangeStatusAPI. ChangeStatusAPI generates & hits MO unsub URL to unsub the services. Premium receives unsub MO and deactivates the service. SE_Daily updates SE_DAILY table and sets SE_PROCESSED=1 for fetched records. Existing process will remain as it is and it'll fetch CHURN records from SE_daily table. 1 New Consumer to fetch prepaid records Prepaid EAI system will push prepaid churn records in prepaid EAI queue which will be consumed by SE system. At SE end, a new consumer module will be developed to fetch prepaid churn records from prepaid EAI queue. It'll be deployed on separate tomcat instance. Record Format- <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <NS2:publishMessage xmlns:NS2=""http://ideacellular.com/integration/publish/events""> <eventHeader> <EVENT_TYPE>CHURN</EVENT_TYPE> <CHANNEL>PREPOL</CHANNEL> <MSISDN>5000000023</MSISDN> <LOB>PrePaid</LOB> <CIRCLE_CODE>DL</CIRCLE_CODE> <EVENT_FILTER> <DND_FLAG>FALSE</DND_FLAG> </EVENT_FILTER> </eventHeader> <eventBody> <CHURN> <CHURN_REASON_CODE>TC</CHURN_REASON_CODE> <CHURN_DATE>16/11/2015</CHURN_DATE> <CHURN_TIME>21:20:14</CHURN_TIME> <ACTIVATION_DATE>12-03-2014</ACTIVATION_DATE> </CHURN> </eventBody> </NS2:publishMessage> New multithreaded consumer will parse the xml and fetch required parameters from xml. It'll also check following parameters before processing the record. 1. Value of EVENT_TYPE should be CHURN or churn. 2. Valid 10 digit MSISDN with 91, same like post-paid. 3. If EVENT_TYPE value is other than CHURN or MSISDN is invalid then system will drop the churn request at consumer module itself. 4. In case mapping of CIRCLE_CODE parameter required then same will be done at consumer. 5. Consumer will also generate a unique transaction ID for each deactivation transaction. To keep uniqueness transactionid's 2rd and 3rd digit will be different and same will be configurable. 6. Consumer will check if received MSISDN record exist in se_subscription_details table or not. If record exists then it'll further process the request else it'll drop the request. 7. For each service in se_subscription_details, consumer will check prepaid flag value from mlist and if it's value is 'Y' (means prepaid) then consumer will create a ticket and push in premium queue for deactivation of services. If it's value is other than 'Y' then it'll check next service. 8. New log file will be created to write prepaid consumer logs. 2 Changes in PostPaidStatus Change Module 1. This module will also parse the value of RequestedDate(Format - dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss) parameter. 2. If received status is ""Pending PD"" then this will select all services for the requested MSISDN. 3. For each service, it'll compare the activation date time of service with received RequestedDate. 4. If activation date time is less than RequestedDate then system will generate unsub ticket and push the same in JMS queue for further processing. 5. If activation date time is greater than RequestedDate then system will not deactivate the service. Sample Request <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?> <scn:IDEAStatusChangeNotifications xmlns:scn=""http://in.ibm.com/schema/StatusChangeNotifications/""> <scn:messageBody> <scn:businessOutputData> <scn:IDEAStatusChangeNotifications> <scn:BANumber>100000085871</scn:BANumber> <scn:SANumber>1000000152070</scn:SANumber> <scn:msisdn>915340255283</scn:msisdn> <scn:status>Pending PD</scn:status> <scn:remarks>Success</scn:remarks> <scn:RequestedSystemName>SADMIN</scn:RequestedSystemName> <scn:RequestedDate>12/12/2012 21:00:00</scn:RequestedDate> <scn:user>SADMIN</scn:user> <scn:notificationDate>12/12/2012 21:00:00</scn:notificationDate> <scn:externalRefNumber>S1-14335561</scn:externalRefNumber> <scn:reason>MNP</scn:reason> <scn:circle>UPE</scn:circle> </scn:IDEAStatusChangeNotifications> </scn:businessOutputData> </scn:messageBody> </scn:IDEAStatusChangeNotifications> 3 Premium Changes Changes will be done at premium level to handle prepaid unsub request which are coming via prepaid consumer. 2 Risks In case request comes in bulk then there is a chance that queue will be built at premium module and this means processing will be slow. 3 Issues 4 Assumption In prepaid EAI queue only prepaid numbers request will be pushed by EAI. At SE level there is no special handling for Hybrid subscribers so for SE, request received via prepaid queue will be treated like a prepaid subscriber and via post-paid queue will be treated like a post-paid subscriber. 5 Dependencies A new tomcat instance is required to deploy new prepaid consumer module. System Affected Areas In order to implement the 'Prepaid post-paid online churn' feature below are the main effective areas where changes are required in SE: 1 API 2 SE Service Configuration (GUI) 3 BOS 4 Premiums Changes to be done at premium end are mention in Section 3.1.3. 5 SE CDR modules No change. 6 CRM 7 Provisioning No change in the Network Provisioning Module. 8 Configuration 9 Reporting No change. 10 Shell Script 11 DB Changes 12 PostPaidStatusChange Changes to be done at premium end are mention in Section 3.1.2. QUERIES 1. For post-paid request's date time comparison do we have to compare RequestedDate or notificationDate?"[m
[31m-"Business Goal: Assist seeker to respond to his questions. Seekerâ€™s profile extraction and ingestion. Visume Chat Bot (Lumen) Scope: User can ask about: Company CEO or leadership team. Company general info Companyâ€™s products Company turnover Organisation structure Cab facility Food/snacks/cafeteria facility Flexi timings Office timings Five day week Work from home policy Mediclaim policy Life Insurance policy Is company MNC? Companyâ€™s office address Companyâ€™s leave policy Maternity policy Appraisal cycle No of interview rounds Time to close open position Jobâ€™s compensation Onsite Opportunity or Foreign trips to employees Attrition rate Firing policy Roles and responsibilities for the Job Hiring Process Steps Human resource response time to candidate Lumen asks to seeker: What is your notice period? Where do you live? What is your current CTC? How many years of working experience do you have? What's your highest level of education/qualification? Who is your current employer/company? Key Features: During conversation, seeker can ask bot to take turn. And then bot proceeds further. Out of scope user queries are handled as part of NLU and dialogues (i.e. stories) Seeker can ask for human handoff during the conversation. Lumen indicates the high level scope of conversation in the beginning. Basic Small talks have also been introduced to make the conversation interesting. Seeker denial (Deny) is taken care of in sharing the info at important places. Abusive words or bad words have been handled during conversation. NLU model accuracy has been improved significantly by introducing Tensor Flow embedding in place of Spacy library. More than 35 K (including 500 top Indian) company names have been looked up to extract the company name from user free text. Top 500 Indian city names have been looked up to extract the user location from user free form text. Lumen asks 6 questions Seeker can asks up to 27 different questions to Lumen. Lumen is an AI bot. Therefore, it learns from the data. As we get more conversation data to train on, the accuracy would be greater. The seekerâ€™s profile extracted by Lumen is stored in a csv file in app directory. Lumenâ€™s responses are configurable in a file but retraining is required after change. Lumen questions are randomized as part of dialogue model. Lumen chatbot app is deployed in Lumata Digitalâ€™s premises only. Technology Used: Python 3.6.5 RASA Stack an open source framework (Rasa NLU â€“ 0.13.8 and Rasa Core â€“ 0.11.3) Slack client GIT Project: http://10.12.224.2/Projects/Visume-Chatbot.git Installation Procedure: Install python 3.x version Clone the project to your app directory pip install â€“r requirements.txt install spacy English language model Follow README.md instructions to train and run the application. Known Issues: Emoticons are not supported in user text. Multi Intents (user asks two queries/intents in one sentence). The user would get one response depending upon the confidence score. Spelling mistakes as part of user queries are not auto corrected in the model. Currently, the model is trained on some sample data created during development. So, the prediction score of intent, entities and actions may go less or wrong. However, training of the models is an on-going process and we would achieve production like accuracy soon.
